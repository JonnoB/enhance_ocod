Address Generator Project Status & Continuation Plan
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project creates synthetic UK address data for training NER models using a tag-based generation system. The generator produces realistic, messy addresses that match the quality and variety found in UK government datasets.
âœ… Completed Components
Core Architecture (100% Complete)

AddressGenerator: Main orchestrator class with tag parsing system
ComponentBuilder: Generates realistic UK address components with tags
StructureGenerator: Determines address complexity (single/range/list properties)
Configuration System: YAML-based config with external name file imports
Tag Processing: Accurate span extraction with underscore support

Generation Features (90% Complete)

âœ… Property type sampling (residential, business, land, carpark, airspace)
âœ… UK postcode generation with realistic case variations
âœ… Street/building name generation with possessives ("Rose's Road")
âœ… Number generation: single, ranges ("5 to 15"), lists ("2, 4, and 6")
âœ… Granular entity tagging (individual numbers get separate spans)
âœ… Filter conditions ("odds only", "evens") with plural variations
âœ… Unit types and IDs for residential properties

Technical Implementation (95% Complete)

âœ… Accurate span calculation with cumulative offset tracking
âœ… Error handling for missing config files and imports
âœ… Extensible base name + suffix combination system
âœ… Configurable probability distributions

ðŸš§ In Progress / Needs Implementation
1. CorruptionEngine (Priority: HIGH)
Status: Planned but not implemented
Location: Currently commented out in AddressGenerator.__init__() and generate_address()
What it should do:

Remove components based on property type (Land parcels often missing cities)
Add formatting inconsistencies (spacing, punctuation)
Create partial addresses
Apply corruption to tagged components before parsing

Implementation outline:
python
